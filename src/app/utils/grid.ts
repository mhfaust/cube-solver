/**
 * Retrieves the position of a single-block within a 3x3x3 CubeGrid from the block's Object3D reference.

 * @param cubeGrid - A 3-dimensional array representing the cube grid. Each element contains a `wrapperMesh`
 *               with a `current` property that holds the children objects.
 * @param blockContainer - The `Object3D` single-block instance to locate within the grid.
 * @returns A tuple of indices `[i, j, k]` representing the position of the cube in the grid,
 *          where each index is constrained to the values 0, 1, or 2. Returns `undefined` if the
 *          container is not found in the grid.
